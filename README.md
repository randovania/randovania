# Randovania
With Randovania, each Metroid Prime 2: Echoes playthrough shuffles the location of all items in the game.
You could find the Light Beam right off the start, or the Bombs deep inside Sanctuary Fortress.  

## Installation

### Windows

In the [releases page](https://github.com/henriquegemignani/randovania/releases) we have zip files with everything ready to use.
Just extract and run!

## Usage

![Randovania GUI](randovania-readme/gui-1.png)

Pressing "Randomize" will open a prompt where you can select your unmodified Metroid Prime 2 ISO file.
You can also drag-n-drop the ISO on the program.

Randovania will then create a new ISO file in the same location of the provided ISO. Please note
this make take a few minutes and requires about 3 GiB of space.

In this window you can also configure many options in how the items will be distributed.
If you're not familiar with many sequence breaking techniques, the default options requires none
of then, allowing any player to finish the game.
