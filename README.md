Here you will be able to randomize many aspects of either game, while still being ensured it's possible to
finish without any trick or glitch! What can be randomized?

* Randomize what can be found in each pickup location, including major upgrades, expansions, keys and artifacts.

* Play with multiple people, via multiworld sessions. Your pickups will be shuffled among the games of
everyone involved, no matter what game they're playing!

* Randomize where each teleporter goes, or what you need to unlock a translator gate. In either case,
there's advanced options for how they're shuffled.

* The location you start the game in as well as the items you start with. If you're feeling brave,
you can even shuffle items you normally start with, like the Power Beam and Scan Visor.

So have fun and start randomizing.

## Setup

Getting started:
   1. Clone this repository (downloading the zip is *not* supported and will not work)
   2. Open a terminal in the repository root
   3. Run the following file:
      1. Windows: `tools/prepare_virtual_env.bat`
      2. Linux/macOS: `tools/prepare_virtual_env.sh`
   4. You should see "Setup finished successfully." visible when the command finishes.
   5. For certain use cases, such as exporting games or running tests, additional setup is needed.

In order to start Randovania, open:
   1. Windows: `tools/start_client.bat`
   2. Linux/macOS: `tools/start_client.sh`

In order to update your repository:
   1. Update the git repository. (With `git pull` or anything else)
   2. Make sure that Randovania is closed.
   3. Re-run the steps from "Getting Started", starting at step 2.
      1. In case of unexpected errors, delete the `venv` in the root of the repository and start again.
   4. Open Randovania normally.

In order to be able to export games:
   1. Run both "Getting started" and "Start Randovania" steps.
   2. Activate the virtual env. Check start_client.bat/sh for details.
   3. Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

In order to run the tests:
   1. Run both "Getting started" and "Start Randovania" steps.
   2. Activate the virtual env. Check start_client.bat/sh for details.
   3. Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   4. Run `python -m pytest test`.

In order to run the server:
   1. Run both "Getting started" and "Start Randovania" steps.
   2. Activate the virtual env. Check start_client.bat/sh for details.
   3. Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   4. Run `python tools/prepare_dev_server_config.py` once.
   5. If you wish to use any Discord functionality, you'll need to create an app in Discord
   and fill both ids in `tools/dev-server-configuration.json`.
   6. Run the server and client. You can this on
      1. Windows with `tools/start_dev_server.bat` for the server and `tools/start_debug_client.bat` for the client
      2. Linux/macOS with `tools/start_dev_server.sh` for the server and `tools_start_debug_client.sh` for client

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). The hook is automatically configured with
the `prepare_virtual_env` scripts.
