# Randovania

With Randovania, each Metroid Prime 2: Echoes playthrough shuffles the location of all items in the game.
You could find the Light Beam right off the start, or the Bombs deep inside Sanctuary Fortress.

Many thanks to [Claris](https://www.twitch.tv/claris) for
making the Echoes Randomizer and both collecting and providing this
incredible set of data which powers Randovania.

Claris also made the included [Menu Mod](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhqqafaxfo3l4vn/Echoes%20Menu.7z),
a tool for practicing Echoes. For more information, see the
[Menu Mod README](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhqqafaxfo3l4vn/Echoes%20Menu.7z?file_subpath=%2FEchoes+Menu%2Freadme.txt).
