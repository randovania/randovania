# Randovania

Welcome to Randovania, a randomizer platform for a multitude of games.

New here or looking to install? Check [our website](https://randovania.org/). It also contains the list of supported games.

<!-- Begin WELCOME -->

Randovania can randomize many aspects of its supported games, all while still ensuring they're completable
without using any glitches or exploits. Its features include:

* Randomizing what can be found in each item location. Weapons, keys, and more can end up in
  completely new places.

* Use Multiworld sessions to shuffle items between multiple separate games, alone or with friends.
  All Multiworld games are compatible with each other - mix and match as you like!

* Randomize how areas connect to one another, or what resources are required to travel between areas.
  These options are highly customizable, letting you limit or unleash the chaos.

* Randomize your starting equipment and location. Feeling brave? You can even shuffle items
  you normally start with.

Have fun and start randomizing!

<!-- End WELCOME -->

# Developer Help

## Dependencies

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
  * This is installed automatically during step 3 of `Getting started`.

## Setup

Getting started:
   1. Clone this repository. If you want to clone your fork, make sure that during the forking process you **uncheck** the `Copy main branch only` checkbox. Because the git history is needed, downloading the zip is *not* supported and will not work.
   2. Open a terminal in the repository root
   3. Run the following file:
      1. Windows: `tools/prepare_virtual_env.bat --thin`
      2. Linux/macOS: `tools/prepare_virtual_env.sh --thin`
   4. You should see "Setup finished successfully." visible when the command finishes.
   5. For certain use cases, such as exporting games or running tests, replace `--thin` with `--full`.

In order to start Randovania, open:
   1. Windows: `tools/start_client.bat`
   2. Linux/macOS: `tools/start_client.sh`

In order to update your repository:
   1. Update the git repository. (With `git pull` or anything else)
   2. Make sure that Randovania is closed.
   3. Re-run the steps from "Getting Started", starting at step 2.
      1. In case of unexpected errors, delete the `.venv` in the root of the repository and start again.
   4. Open Randovania normally.

In order to be able to export games:
   1. Run the "Getting started" step with `--full` instead of `--thin`.
   2. Start Randovania normally.

In order to run the tests:
   1. Run the "Getting started" step with `--full` instead of `--thin`.
   2. Run `uv run pytest`.

In order to run the server:
   1. Run the "Getting started" step.
   2. Run `uv run tools/prepare_dev_server_config.py` once.
   3. If you wish to use any Discord functionality, you'll need to create an app in Discord
   and fill both ids in `tools/dev-server-configuration.json`.
   4. Run the server and client. You can this on
      1. Windows with `tools/start_dev_server.bat` for the server and `tools/start_debug_client.bat` for the client
      2. Linux/macOS with `tools/start_dev_server.sh` for the server and `tools_start_debug_client.sh` for client

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). The hook is automatically configured with
the `prepare_virtual_env` scripts.

Suggested IDE: [PyCharm Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)

## Visual Studio Code

Clone this repository and open the folder in Visual Studio Code. It suggests several useful plugins for developing which you should download and install.

If your Python is setup properly, you can use the `Create venv with all exporters` task by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+P, type in `Task`, select `Tasks: Run task` and then select the task. It will create the venv with all the dependencies installed for you.

Then make sure that the Python extension is installed and select the Python installation from the venv via CTRL+SHIFT+P and `Select Python: Interpreter`.

There is also a task defined to run all tests. To run individual tests you can utilise the `Testing` section of Visual Studio Code. You can simply run or debug a test there.

To start Randovania you can press CTRL+F5. If you only press F5, Randovania will start with a debugger. Be aware that starting with a debugger makes the application much slower.

## UV Commands

Updating a single package:
```
uv lock --upgrade-package my-dependency
```

Installing your patcher as editable:
```
uv pip install -e ..\factorio-randovania-mod\
```
