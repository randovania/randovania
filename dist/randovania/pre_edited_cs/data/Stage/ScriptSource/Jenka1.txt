You're a soldier from
the surface, aren't you.<NOD<CLR.....<NOD<CLRIt wasn't long ago that
hundreds of robots like
you came to this island.<NOD
Countless Mimigas perished
at their hands.<NOD
As did the humans who
tried to protect them.<NOD<CLRCornered, the Mimigas
finally ingested the
forbidden red flowers,<NOD
and in their murderous
rage began to strike
back against the robots.<NOD<CLRHad the red flowers not
existed, the Mimigas might
have vanished entirely<NOD
from the island...<NOD<CLRThree more left.<NODGood luck.<NOD<FL+0591<END

<KEY<MSG<FAC0013Oooh.<NOD<CLR<GIT1014Yes, yes.<NOD
That is certainly one of

We're up to three now...<NOD<CLR.....<NOD<CLRHave you ever seen a
frenzied Mimiga?<NOD<CLRThe cornered Mimigas hoped
that the red flowers
would grant them strength.<NOD
They ate them, and then
they fought the robots.<NOD<CLR
However...<NOD<CLRDo you know what
happened to them
afterwards?<NOD<CLR.....<NOD<CLRIt is a sad tale...<NOD
The enraged Mimigas,
likely unable to control
their own actions,<NOD
disappeared without a
trace.<NOD
If rumors are to be
trusted, they descended
to the surface,<NOD
where humans live.<NOD<CLRAn army of ferocious
Mimigas loosed upon
the earth...<NOD
If that were true...<NOD<CLRDo you understand now?<NOD
Do you understand how
dangerous the red
flowers are?<NOD<CLR.....<NOD<CLRTwo more to go...<NOD<FL+0592<END

Wherein lie the seeds to
the red flowers...<NOD<CLRI don't care who you
