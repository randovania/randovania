     - For each item, you can now choose between:
        - You start with it
        - It's in the vanilla location
        - It's shuffled and how many copies there are

        that ammo, you'll have the target total count.

-    **MAJOR**: Added progressive items. These items gives different items when you collect then,
        based on how many you've already collected. There are two:

    scan and even the pickup text.

     You can choose to replace the model with ETM or with a random other item, for even more troll.

      combination that identifies the seed being played.
