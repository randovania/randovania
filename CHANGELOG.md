### Metroid Dread

- **Major** - Added: Elevator and Shuttle randomizer. The destination is shown on the elevator/shuttle's minimap icon and in the room name, if enabled. This will show different area names to the logic database for some items.
- **Major** - Added: Split beams and missiles. When playing with non-progressive beams or missiles, each individual upgrade provides a unique effect instead of providing the effects of all previous upgrades.
- Added: An in-game icon will appear if the player becomes disconnected from the multiworld server.

- Added: Logic to handle having Ice Missiles without Super Missile.
- Added: In Ghavoran - Teleport to Burenia, Cross Bomb Skip using just Morph Ball to get to and from the Pickup. Rated one level higher than the corresponding usage with Flash Shift or Spin Boost.

- Changed: Added Wide Beam to missile farming during Kraid's fight.

- Changed: Dodging in all Chozo-X fights now has Flash Shift as trivial, Spin Boost with Beginner Combat, and nothing with Intermediate.
- Changed: In Dairon - Teleport to Artaria, breaking the speed blocks is no longer "dangerous". This is done by removing the "Before Event" condition on breaking the blocks from above.
- Changed: In Artaria - Water Reservoir, breaking the blob is no longer "dangerous", as long as Slide is not randomized. This was previously dangerous because there's a connection in EMMI Zone Exit Southwest that makes use of Speed Booster, however, by simply adding a "Can Slide" option on the same condition, the logic now sees the blob as safe.
- Changed: In Burenia: Fighting Drogyga is now only "dangerous" if Highly Dangerous Logic is enabled. This is achieved by adding a Highly Dangerous Logic constraint on all instances where the logic uses "Before Drogyga" on connections in the Underneath Drogyga room.

- Changed: In Burenia - Main Hub Tower Middle, lowering the Spider Magnet Wall is now "dangerous" only when Highly Dangerous Logic is enabled. The connection from the bottom of the room to the Pickup Platform that uses Grapple Movement requires the Spider Magnet Wall to not be lowered now requires Highly Dangerous Logic. The randomizer currently doesn't have the necessary options to make this connection mandatory in any seeds anyway.
- Changed: Most instances of pushing Wide Beam Blocks by using Wave Beam through walls now no longer need Wide Beam. Notable exception is Dairon - West Transport to Ferenia, from below.
- Changed: Boss fight logic using Ice Missile without Super Missile is no longer an option, and effectively requires as many missiles as with normal Missiles.
- Changed: Boss fight logic now understands how damage values work with Split Beams behavior.
  - Affected bosses: Robot Chozo fights, Chozo X fights and Raven Beak.
  - Having only Plasma Beam or only Wave Beam is only used to fight the Robot Chozos, at Combat Intermediate.

  - Having Wide Beam and Wave Beam is considered as the same bracket as Wide Beam and Plasma Beam.
- Changed: Exclude Ghavoran door between Flipper Room and Elun Transport Access from being shuffled as a Grapple Beam door in Door Lock rando. This is to enable a Ledge Warp to flip the Spinner from below.
- Changed: In Ghavoran - Flipper Room, rotating the flipper the normal way can now be in logic before having pulled the Grapple Block at Right Entrance or having turned on Power Switch 2 in Dairon, if Transport Randomizer is enabled.
- Changed: Revised logic for fighting Corpius
  - When using missiles without an ammo requirement, the X must not have been released.
  - Using Cross Bomb is moved to Combat Beginner
  - For Missiles, Super Missiles and Ice Missiles, the number of required missiles is reduced by 1, which matches the pre-existing comments. These alternatives remain Combat Intermediate.
  - For Missiles, Super Missiles and Ice Missiles, these can now also be used without combat tricks, but you need 1.5x as many units of Missiles ammo as the combat trick version.
  - Added Storm Missiles.
- Fixed: A typo in the room name Ferenia - East Transport to Dairon has been changed from East Transport to Darion.
- Fixed: In Burenia - Teleport to Ghavoran, to open the Plasma Beam door from below, add requirement to have Plasma Beam. This becomes relevant with Separate Beam Behavior.

-   Added a version check. Once a day, the application will check GitHub if there's a new version.

This is much more CPU friendly and faster than searching for seeds, but is currently experimental: generation is prone to errors and items concentrated in early locations.
