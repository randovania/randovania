#### Main Reactor (Agon Wastes)

The spider tracks only works after you beat Dark Samus 1 and reload the room. When playing with no tricks, this means you need Dark Beam to escape the room.

#### Dynamo Works (Sanctuary Fortress)

The spider tracks only works after you beat Spider Guardian. When playing with no tricks, you can't leave this way until you do that.

#### Spider Guardian fight (Sanctuary Fortress)

During the fight, the spider tracks only works in the first and last phases. After the fight, they all work normally.
This means you need Boost Ball to fight Spider Guardian."""),
