1. ABOUT

The Randomizer switches around the locations of all pickups/expansions. This includes:
- Each pickup's properties, model, dialog box, jingle, etc. are all changed to the new pickup's.
- The pickup's position is adjusted, as otherwise some pickups are naturally higher/lower than others.
- The cutscene when collecting a previously major pickup is removed; it would still play the cutscene for the original pickup, which would make no sense with the new pickup.
- Adds/removes layer switches for Artifacts/Old-Artifacts, so that Artifacts properly activate Artifact Temple (and their replacements do not). Also adds/removes the automatic pause after collecting an Artifact.
- The Phazon Suit and Translator pickups are given custom models, as they do not have unique models in the original games.

Known issues:
- Echoes may be too large after running the Randomizer to properly rebuild/run on console. You can try using the included "Disable Echoes Attract Videos" program, which removes the title screen attract videos. Another solution is to remove the Multiplayer music (files multi-defbgm32.dsp and/or multiplay9-32-3.dsp in the Audio folder; either delete them outright, or replace them with a blank file if required by your rebuilding method).
- The Randomizer is not guaranteed to be completable; there are currently no checks to ensure items are not placed in impossible-to-obtain locations (for example, Supers/Charge behind Cordite, or Dark Visor in an Ing Cache).
- The Translator pickups in Echoes do not have their scans added to a SAVW, as the game would think existing saves are corrupt; because of this, scanning Translators may sometimes have issues.

Thanks to:
- Aruki, who has been a major help in learning how to modify the game/understanding the file formats/etc.
- xinoea for creating the texture for the custom Phazon Suit model.
- Jordan Rinehart (French/Japanese), HatWolf (German), Dario FF (Spanish), and LetsPlayNintendoITA (Italian) for translating the Temple Key strings.

NOTE: You should not use an already created save with the Randomizer (i.e. a [Starting World] 00% 00:00 save). Due to changes to room layers, you should always use a new save, even between different randomizations.



2. PREREQUISITES

The Randomizer does not edit an ISO directly; you need to extract the files from the Prime or Echoes ISO. This can be done with Dolphin (right-click the game > Filesystem > right-click Disc > Extract All Files...), or using a program such as GC Rebuilder.



3. PROGRAM USAGE

Randomizer [Folder] -g [MP1/MP2] -s [Seed] -e [Excluded Pickups] [Options]

[Folder]: The folder containing the game's files to randomize.

-g [MP1/MP2]: The game you wish to randomize. If not provided, the Randomizer will attempt to open Metroid2.pak and check the version of the game there.

-s [Seed]: The random seed, if you wish to reuse a previous randomization. The seed must be between 0 and 2147483647. Note that using a different excluded pickup list, or a different version of the Randomizer, will likely give a different result.

-e [Excluded Pickups]: Pickups that should not be randomized. Use the pickup numbers listed at the bottom of the readme, separated by commas with no spaces; for example, "-e 5,19,28" would exclude the Morph Ball, Missile Launcher, and Bombs in Prime. If not given, then by default Prime excludes Morph Ball, Missile Launcher, and Bombs; Echoes excludes the Violet Translator. If you wish to randomize every pickup, enter "-e none" instead.

Options: -hivw

-h: HUD Memo Popup Removal. Changes the type of HUD Memo used for pickups, to remove the popup. Also removes Artifact pauses in Prime. Note that certain pickups that immediately play a cutscene will not have their popup removed.

-i: Item Loss Removal. In Prime, this gives you the same items you start with on the Frigate when you land on Tallon. In Echoes, this switches the layers in Hive Chamber B, so the room is in its post-Item Loss state.

-v: Elevator Randomization Mode: Randomizes how elevators are connected to each other. Cannot connect an elevator to a different elevator in the same world. In Prime, if Morph Ball or Bombs are excluded, the first elevator connecting Tallon Overworld and Chozo Ruins will not be changed.

-w: Random Warp Mode. The game will warp you to a random room every time you collect an unexcluded pickup. Prime cannot warp you to the Frigate or Impact Crater; Echoes cannot warp you to the Sky Temple or rooms used solely for cutscenes.

v4.0
- Fixed various issues with multiple copies of the same pickup.
- Starting the Dark Samus 1 fight disables adjacent rooms from loading automatically (fixes a potential crash).
- Beating Dark Samus 1 will now turn off the first pass pirates layer in Biostorage Station (fixes a potential crash).
- Agon Temple's first door no longer stays locked after Bomb Guardian until you get the Agon Energy Controller item.
- Leaving during the Grapple Guardian fight no longer causes Grapple Guardian to not drop an item if you come back and fight it again.
- Undertemple Access's default spawn point has been moved in-bounds.
- The Luminoth barriers that appear on certain doors after collecting or returning a world's energy have been removed.
- Cutscenes are now always skippable, even on a brand new save file.
- Translator pickup scans are added to the save, fixing potential issues with scanning them.
- Percent is calculated by how many items there are that count for percent, so 100% will be "all percent increasing items" no matter the quantity of them.
- Credits are now optionally sped up to be 60 seconds long (over 4x faster).
- Removed some instances in Main Research, to decrease the chance of a crash coming from Central Area Transport West. Also fixed leaving the room midway through destroying the echo locks making it impossible to complete.
- The scans in Sky Temple Gateway now tell you the location of each Sky Temple Key.
- Power Bombs no longer instantly kill either Alpha Splinter's first phase or Spider Guardian (doing so would not actually end the fight, leaving you stuck).
- Hard Mode is now immediately unlocked on a new save file.


V3.2 - May 15th, 2016
General:
- Elevator Randomization Mode option added. (-v)
- Pickups now retain the original pickup's collision.

Prime-specific:
- The Phazon Suit pickup's scale is reduced, to match the Varia and Gravity pickups.
- The Thermal Visor plays a sound effect when collected.

Echoes-specific:
- Pickups replacing Translators are no longer potentially duplicated.


V3.1 - January 26th, 2016
Random Warp Mode actually runs now.


V3.0 - December 14th, 2015
General:
- The Prime and Echoes Randomizers have been combined into a single program, and rewritten almost entirely from scratch.
- Additional instances and pickup assets are now put on their own newly-created layer instead of an existing layer (mostly; the Energy Transfer Module requires instances added on the same layer as the pickup to work properly).
- HUD Memo Popup Removal option added. (-h)
- The Mission Final screen displays the Randomizer version and Seed.
- Pickup positions are now adjusted horizontally in addition to vertically. Only really matters for Keys in Echoes.
- Various other minor unimportant changes.

Prime-specific:
- Item Loss Removal option added, to match with Echoes. (-i)
- If an Artifact replaces Main Power Bombs or the Phazon Suit, the game now pauses at the correct time.

Echoes-specific:
- Translators are now randomized. Their model is the Scan Visor used in the logbook, with the inner section colored the Translator's color. A pickup has been added in each Energy Controller instead of scanning the hologram.
- Violet Translator is excluded by default, to make navigating Temple Grounds at the start of the game a lot easier.
- The Energy Transfer Module is now moved correctly (was previously invisible and potentially game-crashing), and is no longer excluded by default.
- Random Warp option added, to match with Prime. (-w)
- Fixed a crash when obtaining Grapple outside of Torvus on PAL.
- The Light Suit and Translators will reset any ConditionalRelays used in the room or adjacent rooms, so you can't get stuck under Dark Water or behind a Translator Gate after obtaining them.
- The cutscenes before the pickups in Dark Torvus Temple and Main Gyro Chamber now show the correct randomized pickup.
- Removed "Randomize Music" and "Enable Pickup Cutscenes" options as they were pretty useless.


Prime V2.0 - August 23rd, 2014
Randomizer additions:
- .pak files are now edited directly; unpacking/repacking them is no longer necessary.
- Versions other than NTSC 0-00 are now supported. However, they have not been thoroughly tested, so use at your own risk; NTSC 0-00 is the recommended version to use.
- Random Warp option added, making the game warp you to a random room in the 5 main areas after collecting unexcluded pickups.
- Log file format updated, aligning each column and removing the original pickup.
- Creates a folder for log files inside the Randomizer's folder if it does not already exist.

In-Game fixes:
- Artifact of Truth is now required to beat the game, and is no longer excluded by default.
- Cutscene skips updated, getting rid of the .6 second loss of control after getting a major pickup among other things.
- If Artifact Temple has an artifact, its layer is turned on by default, so the room doesn't have to be reloaded to trigger Ridley if collected last.
- Artifacts now pause the game, while pickups replacing Artifacts do not.
- Fixed the cutscene skip for pickups replacing Wave and X-Ray, so they now have the HUD Memo popup.
- Pickups replacing Varia and Gravity now play the correct jingle.
- Pickups retain the original pickup's fade-in (used for pickups replacing Wild, Warrior, and Spider).
- Pickup positions slightly adjusted; positions were previously based on their bottom, while now they're based on their center.
