    # Guidelines for joke hints:
    # 1. They should clearly be jokes, and not real hints or the result of a bug.
    # 2. They shouldn't reference real-world people.
    # 3. They should be understandable by as many people as possible.
    # All games that have joke hints will use this list and any joke hints defined by the game.
